Introduction
Welcome to the Note-Taking App! 
This application allows you to create, edit, and organize your notes effectively. With a user-friendly interface and rich text editing capabilities, the app simplifies the process of note-taking and organization.

Technical Overview
Tech Stack
The Note Taking App is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for its full-stack development. Key libraries and frameworks include:
Frontend: React, Redux (for state management), Axios (for API calls)
Backend: Express.js (for RESTful API), MongoDB (as the database)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization
Folder Structure
The project follows a structured folder hierarchy:

note-taking-app/
  ├── client/
  │   ├── public/
  │   ├── src/
  │   │   ├── actions/
  │   │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── reducers/

  │   └── ...
  ├── server/
  │   ├── config/
  │   ├── controllers/
  │   ├── models/
